Project Changelog & Session Summary
Date: February 20, 2026
Primary Goal: Complete Sprint 3 (Database & Lambda) and begin Sprint 4 (API Gateway).

Sprint 3 Completion: A Manual Deployment Victory
The initial part of the session was dedicated to overcoming a series of critical, environment-specific roadblocks that prevented a standard CLI-based deployment.

Key Accomplishments:

Diagnosed and Bypassed CloudShell Limitations: We definitively proved that the AWS CloudShell environment was unsuitable for sam local invoke and sam build due to a cascade of issues, including:

Docker architecture mismatches (arm64 vs. x86_64).

Insufficient disk space (no space left on device).

A persistent, broken Lambda service cache (Unable to import module 'lambda_function').

Pivoted to a Successful Manual Deployment Strategy:

Created and deployed a simplified CloudFormation template (template.yaml) that successfully provisioned the PasswordVaultTable (DynamoDB) and the LambdaExecutionRole (IAM).

Manually created the dev-PasswordVaultFunction in the Lambda console, linking it to the correct IAM role and setting the TABLE_NAME environment variable.

Resolved the persistent import error by creating a new main.py file and updating the Lambda handler to main.handler, proving the issue was a broken cache on the AWS backend.

Sprint 3 Goal Achieved: The session concluded with a successful end-to-end test from the Lambda console, proving that the function could write an item to the DynamoDB table.

Sprint 4 Progress: API Gateway and Custom Domain
With the backend in place, we began integrating it with the outside world via API Gateway.

Key Accomplishments:

API Design: Created the API_DESIGN.md documentation, outlining the endpoints and methods for the password vault API.

Infrastructure Provisioned: Updated the CloudFormation stack to create the following API Gateway resources:

An HTTP API (PasswordVaultApi).

An integration and route for the POST /entries endpoint.

A default stage for deployment.

A custom domain resource (ApiDomain) for dev-api.vosahlik-vault.com, linked to your existing ACM certificate.

Permissions Granted: Successfully added the necessary Lambda resource policy to allow API Gateway to invoke the dev-PasswordVaultFunction.

Final DNS Configuration: Created the final CNAME record in Route 53 to point dev-api.vosahlik-vault.com to the API Gateway's domain name.

Current Status:

The entire infrastructure is now fully configured. We are waiting for the final DNS record to propagate across the internet, which will make the custom URL https://dev-api.vosahlik-vault.com/entries live and active. The final step of Sprint 4 will be to successfully test this endpoint.
